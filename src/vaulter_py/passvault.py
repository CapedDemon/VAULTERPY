                            Working with VAULTERPY is pretty easy.

                    1. When starting the vaulterpy, you need to select two things
                        - P -> To work with already created vaults, or database
                        - N -> To create a new vault/database
                        You need to first click any one of these, else you will be not able to do others.
                    
                    2. K -> This will generate a secret key, in the file .key extension which
                        will be specified by you.

                    3. L -> Loading the key is very important. From, initialisation, the default key is None.
                        So, to insert passwords and encrypt them secret key need to be loaded.
                        As well as for retriving passwords.

                    4. I -> This will allow you to insert passwords in the vault.
                        You need to give the password and the key of password, 
                        means for which thing you are keeping the password.

                    5. H -> This will show you the help guide, in which you are in now.

                    6. Q -> This will Quit the program.
